Resource Wall - a single page web app from @npwxx and @jamesbrown5292

=========

## Project description

Resource Wall is a single page web application that gives users a place to catalogue and interact with their favourite websites and other resources from around the web. 

In the My Boards page, users see a list of tiles. Each of these tiles represents a thematically-organized 'board' containing links to resources from around the web pertaining to that category. 

Users can add, edit, rate, like and comment on a resource. Statistics relating to users, boards and resources are captured in various places around the app, and users can browse boards using these as filters. 

Categories are a key feature of Resource Wall. Board owners can edit the categories they have assigned to their boards and resources, while all users can search for categories of particular interest to them.
